## Steps to Run Application
1. Clone Github repo and cd into the folder from the terminal
2. Install nvm and node
3. Install nodemon using `npm install -g nodemon`
4. Run `npm start` for both frontend folder and backend folder in 2 different terminal/consoles

## Considerations
**Microservice architecture**: Frontend and backend are two different microservices hosted on two different servers 3000 and 3001

**Security**: Encryption of userData cookie
  * In the path /Backend/server.js line 71, the userData is encrypted. In line 72, the encrypted cookie is set.
  * The encryption and decryption methods are stored in /Backend/encrypt.js
  * The initialization vector and encryption key are randomly generated in /Backend/encrypt.js
  * When a request is made via the front end, the decryption method is called to decrypt the cookie. This can be seen in /Backend/server.js line 125 and line 182

**Deployment**: Cloud databases
  * Firestore for backend processing (refer to backend/model/firebaseconfig.js)
  * MySQL hosted on AWS RDS for frontend displays (refer to backend/model/databaseconfig.js)
